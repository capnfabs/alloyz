It's a web-app for calculating the percentage of pure metals to use for sandcasting based on what I learned at
[sz.jewelrystudio](https://www.instagram.com/sz.jewelrystudio/) sandcasting workshop.

It:
- Is vibe-coded using Copilot chat (I think maybeee 3 lines are written by hand)
- Doesn't have tests
- Uses Tailwind for styling, Parcel for bundling
- Works offline thanks to service workers.
